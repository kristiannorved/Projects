            <p class="beliefs-heading">We believe that we have the greatest news imaginable to
                share with you. Here's some specifics:</p>
            <p class="beliefs-subheading"><em>THE BIBLE</em></p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The Bible is the divine inspiration and trustworthiness of the Holy Scripture
                     as originally given, and their supreme authority in all matters of faith and 
                     conduct.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="beliefs-subheading"><em>GOD</em></p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The unity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the Godhead.</li>
                <li>The sovereign work of God in creation, revelation, redemption, judgment and 
                    establishing His kingdom.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="beliefs-subheading"><em>HUMANITY</em></p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The creation of men and women together in the image of God and together 
                    having dominion over the created order.</li>
                <li>The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the fall, rendering 
                    all people subject to God's wrath and condemnation, and unable to turn 
                    themselves to God without the prior regenerating work of God's Spirit, who 
                    convicts the world of sin, righteousness and judgment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="beliefs-subheading"><em>JESUS CHRIST AND SALVATION</em></p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The conception of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit, and his birth by the 
                    virgin Mary. He is both God and sinless man.</li>
                <li>Redemption from the guilt, penalty and power of sin, only through the 
                    sacrificial death, as our representative and substitute, of Jesus Christ, the 
                    incarnate Son of God, demonstrating God's love to us most perfectly and his 
                    victory over Satan and his forces.</li>
                <li>The physical resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead in flesh, bones and 
                    body.</li>
                <li>The necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit to make the death of Christ 
                    effective in individual sinners, granting them repentance towards God and faith
                    in Jesus Christ, so that salvation is entirely of God's grace and not of their
                    merit or good works.</li>
                <li>The expectation of the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory to 
                    judge the living and the dead.</li>
