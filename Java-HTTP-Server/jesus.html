        <div class="text-block">
            <p class="jesus-heading">Who is Jesus?</p>
            <p class="jesus-subheading">We believe Jesus is the most important 
                person you will ever meet. It would be our joy for you to join 
                us in worshipping him.</p>
            <p class="jesus-text">Two thousand years ago, in fulfilment of many 
                prophecies made to the Jewish people, Jesus was born in the town
                 of Bethlehem. Jesus was a human, just like us, but there was 
                 something about him that makes him entirely different to us. 
                 He was perfect! Jesus never rebelled against God's laws, and 
                 never sinned.<br><br>
                 In time, Jesus grew to be a man, and attracted 
                 enormous crowds with his super-natural miracles. Jesus healed the 
                 sick with a touch, calmed storms with a word, and even raised the 
                 dead back to life! Again and again, Jesus publicly demonstrated 
                 that he had power over nature, sickness, evil, and death. Again and
                 again, Jesus publicly demonstrated that he had the power of 
                 God!<br><br>
                 Who was this Jesus? We're not left guessing, because on more than 
                 one occasion Jesus explicitly stated that he was the Son of God! 
                 Is that hard to believe? The religious leaders of the day thought 
                 so too. They charged Jesus with blasphemy, condemned him to death, 
                 and nailed him to a wooden cross where he died.<br><br>
                 Many people thought this was the end of Jesus's ministry, but three days later, Jesus 
                 proved that he was the Son of God by rising himself from the dead. 
                 Hundreds of people saw the risen Jesus, the news spread like wildfire, 
                 and the world has never been the same again.<br><br>
                 What does Jesus want from you? He wants you to admit that you haven't lived your life 
                 honouring and obeying God. He wants you to admit that you deserve 
                 God's anger and punishment. He wants you to trust that he died on 
                 the cross in your place taking the punishment that you deserve. And 
                 he wants you to live your life joyfully following Him.<br><br>
                 Shortly after conquering death, Jesus ascended back into Heaven, promising that one 
                 day He will return. When He does, those who ignore or reject Jesus 
                 will face God's just judgement in Hell, while those who trust in 
                 Jesus will experience the eternal joy of Heaven.
