# Projects
A collection of projects that I am working on to improve my software development skills. Currently, the list of projects is as follows:
- **Song-Recommendations**: a machine learning project made to recommend songs based on the interests of a given user (using the `popularity_recommender_py` class made by [dvysardana](https://github.com/dvysardana/RecommenderSystems_PyData_2016/blob/master/Recommenders.py))
- **Java-HTTP-Server**: a simple HTTP server that runs in Java.
